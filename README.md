# `Z4NR34L` - Mateusz Janota
## Hello there, nice to see you!

I am a dedicated professional with a lifelong passion for IT, specializing in software engineering and cybersecurity. With a wealth of experience and a deep commitment to excellence, I currently serve as a Senior Software Engineer at `INNPRO`, where I lead the Software Engineering Team to deliver cutting-edge solutions. I contribute my expertise to `Golden Bow Solutions`, working on high-impact projects for some of the biggest brands in Poland.

In addition to my professional and community contributions, I am also the founder of `Rescale`, a company dedicated to providing custom software development and serverless services on our own platform. At Rescale, we specialize in creating tailored solutions, but also for example an advanced events gateway for webhooks or external APIs, designed to meet the unique needs of our clients.

My journey in IT is driven by a desire to mentor others, share knowledge, and continuously push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in technology. Whether leading a team, solving complex problems, or building groundbreaking platforms, I am committed to making a lasting impact in the world of software engineering and cybersecurity.
