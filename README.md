# `Z4NR34L` - Mateusz Janota
## Hello there, nice to see you!

I'm a dedicated professional with a lifelong passion for IT, serving as both a mentor and an expert in software engineering and cybersecurity. Currently, I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at `INNPRO`, leading the Software Engineering Team. In addition, I contribute to `Vercel` where I assist others with their `Next.js` issues and contribute to their OSS projects. I also lend my expertise to other OSS projects such as `Novel` and `leerob.io`.
